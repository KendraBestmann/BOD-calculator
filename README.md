# BOD-calculator
This JavaScript-based tool calculates Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) for wastewater analysis, improving precision in water quality assessment. Users input initial and final dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and a dilution factor to get instant BOD results. It aids researchers, engineers, and students in evaluating water pollution levels efficiently.
